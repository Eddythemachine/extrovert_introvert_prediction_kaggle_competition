Shape of the dataset: (18524, 8)


üìà Insights from Value Counts by Feature
Time Spent Alone
The most common response was 0 hours spent alone, accounting for 3,139 participants, followed 
closely by 3 hours (3,081) and 2 hours (3,039). This suggests that while many individuals report 
spending no time alone, a significant portion still spends 1‚Äì3 hours alone daily. Very few 
participants reported spending extended time alone (10+ hours), indicating that long durations of 
solitude are relatively uncommon in the dataset.

Social Event Attendance
Attendance is fairly high across most mid-range values. The most frequent responses were 4 to 9 
events per month, with 4.0 (2,073), 9.0 (2,063), and 7.0 (2,031) standing out. 
This reflects a socially active demographic, where the majority of respondents attend 
multiple social events monthly. Only a small number reported no or very minimal attendance
(0‚Äì1 events), suggesting low social participation is rare.

Going Outside
The data shows that 5.0 to 6.0 times per week is the most typical frequency for going outside, 
with 5.0 (2,923) and 3.0 (2,822) being especially common. This implies a generally mobile 
population that frequently leaves the house. Lower frequencies (0‚Äì2 times) had fewer counts, 
indicating that most participants are not highly isolated or sedentary.

Friends Circle Size
The size of participants‚Äô friend circles is distributed quite evenly across multiple values, 
with 5.0 (1,669) being the most reported. Other common responses include 4.0, 8.0, 10.0, 11.0, and 
12.0, all clustering around the mid-range (1000+ counts each). 
This wide spread suggests considerable variability in social networks, 
though having between 4‚Äì12 friends appears to be a typical range. 
Very small friend circles (0‚Äì2) are less frequent, pointing to generally moderate to large 
social circles.

Post Frequency
Posting frequency on social media shows a peak at 3.0 posts (2,258), with a gradual tapering 
toward higher and lower values. Still, a substantial number of users post regularly ‚Äî between 4.0 
to 9.0 times, indicating active engagement. Lower posting frequency (0‚Äì1) is less common but still 
significant, revealing a mix of social media habits among respondents.

üß† Summary
Across all variables, participants show moderate to high levels of social activity, outdoor 
engagement, and digital presence. Solitude is limited, friend circles are mid-sized or larger, 
and most individuals remain socially and physically active both online and offline. 
These patterns may reflect a population with balanced social lives, neither excessively 
isolated nor hyper-connected.

üìà Insights from Categorical Features
Stage Fear
A large majority of respondents (12,609) reported not having stage fear, while 4,022 admitted to experiencing it.

A notable 1,893 entries are missing (NaN), which may reflect reluctance to disclose or incomplete responses.

Insight: Most individuals are comfortable with public exposure or performance, but a substantial group (~24%) still experiences stage fear. This may have implications for group activities, presentations, or social confidence indicators.

Drained After Socializing
13,313 participants (the majority) said ‚ÄúNo‚Äù, suggesting they do not feel drained after socializing.

4,062 individuals said ‚ÄúYes‚Äù, indicating they do feel drained, which can be associated with 
introverted traits or social fatigue.

1,149 missing values may signal uncertainty or context-based variability in how people interpret 
social exhaustion.

Insight: Most respondents likely draw energy from social interactions, aligning with extroverted or 
socially comfortable behaviors. However, a significant portion (~23%) experiences social burnout, which can influence social habits and event preferences.

Personality
The dataset is dominated by Extroverts (13,699), with Introverts (4,825) forming about 26% of the 
responses.

This shows a 3:1 ratio, possibly skewed due to the platform used for data collection (e.g., more 
extroverts willing to participate).

Insight: With extroverts being the majority, trends in social behavior (e.g., event attendance, 
posting frequency) may lean toward higher engagement. However, the introvert group is large enough to 
offer meaningful contrast in behavioral modeling.

üîç Cross-Variable Implication:
The high proportion of extroverts aligns with the large number of people reporting no stage fear and 
not feeling drained after socializing.

However, the presence of thousands of individuals who do experience stage fear, social fatigue, or 
identify as introverts highlights the need for nuanced segmentation when analyzing social behavior, 
event attendance, or digital engagement.


## üìä Insights on Outliers by Personality Type

| Personality | Total Count | Outliers | Outlier Percentage |
|-------------|-------------|----------|---------------------|
| Introvert   | 4,825       | 1,543    | **31.98%**          |
| Extrovert   | 13,699      | 110      | **0.80%**           |

---

### üß† Interpretation & Insights

1. **Introverts Exhibit Significantly More Outliers**  
   - About **1 in 3 introverts** (31.98%) fall outside the normal range in the observed variable 
   (e.g., `Time_spent_Alone`).
   - In contrast, only **0.8% of extroverts** are considered outliers in the same metric.

2. **Behavioral Skewness Toward Extremes in Introverts**  
   - This suggests that **introverts are more likely to engage in behavior that deviates from 
    the norm**.
   - Extroverts, by comparison, show **more consistent behavior**.

3. **Data Implication**  
   - Data distributions for introverts may be **more skewed**, requiring tailored preprocessing 
   such as **robust scaling** or **log transformation**.
   - Machine learning models could benefit from **personality-aware feature engineering** or 
   stratified training.

4. **Targeted Recommendations**  
   - Analytics or behavioral modeling should account for **greater variability among introverts**.
   - Personalized strategies (e.g., marketing, health, or social recommendations) should be 
   sensitive to this divergence.
